The site is located in Yaser Street of Tehran, Iran and has a slope of about
20%. A number of trees are already located in the site. To comply with the principles
of sustainable architecture, my design preserves the trees. The concept of this design
originates from the site itself the shape of the building is consistent with the
environmental conditions of the site. The footprint of the villa is a 15m*20m rectangle.
The 3*4 grid shown in the picture determines the location of the columns.
