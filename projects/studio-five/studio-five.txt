The idea of this project is retrieved from the landâ€™s site. This site is too steep
and has a special topography. To preserve the beautiful nature of this site according
to sustainable architecture, each floor of the building is located on the layers of
topography that is excavated and with a little rotation in each floor, they are placed
on top of each other. All the efforts in design of this residential complex were to
preserve the sustainable sense of nature.
